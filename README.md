### Retarded Green's function of 1D chain
The objective is to find a relation between advanced and retarded Green's function for a spin transport
system. The idea came from the fact that if an imaginary part that is not spin-state mixing can contaminate
the whole matrix of the retarded and advanced Green's function. In other words, a general Green's function
is a Hermitian matrix since the Hamiltonian is, however by adding small positive (negative) imaginary part
to calculate the advanced (retarded) Green's function, then the matrix enteries are not related. 

In this code, a Hamiltonian of a spin-dependent chain is constructed, then spin-orbit dependent and Zeeman
scattering is added to the Hamiltonian. Finally the retarded Green's function is calculated by matrix inversion
and no meaningful relation beside the definition is found in the structure.
